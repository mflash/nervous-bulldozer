        <h3>Welcome to Nervous Bulldozer</h3>

<p>This is a project with the goal of integrating a resource allocation system into Moodle.</p>

<p>The idea is to allow educational institutions to full employ Moodle as their LMS as well
as a central manager for resources such as labs, laptops allowed to be borrowed, etc.</p>

<p>The main goal of the system is the automatic allocation of resources, according to requests sent by the users (e.g. lecturers). This integration will also allow direct transfer of data to and from the Moodle calendar.</p>
